    <h2>Volunteer!</h2>
    We can always use extra hands at our events to help set up and break down, attend to our fundraising activities during the show, and generate media (photos, video).  There are also opportunities to volunteer for our community outreach events, which might include plating trees, cleaning the region, or helping others with their community events.  You can indicate your interest in volunteering when you sign up for the events. Or feel free to email us at save.earth@gmail.com to let us know how you'd like to help.
